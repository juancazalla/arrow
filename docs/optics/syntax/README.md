## Syntax DSL

In some cases the full power of Optics is not required and a familiar property-like syntax to work with values of immutable structures is desired.
To avoid boilerplate Arrow can generate this property-like dsl using `@optics` annotation.

```kotlin
package com.example.domain

@optics
data class Street(val number: Int, val name: String)
@optics
data class Address(val city: String, val street: Street)
@optics
data class Company(val name: String, val address: Address)
@optics
data class Employee(val name: String, val company: Company?)
```

The DSL will be generated in a syntax sub-package of your `data class` and can be used by invoking `setter()` on an instance. i.e. for a package `com.example.domain` the DSL will be generated in `com.example.domain.syntax`.

```kotlin
import com.example.domain.*
import com.example.domain.syntax.*

val employee = Employee("John Doe", Company("Kategory", Address("Functional city", Street(42, "lambda street"))))

employee.setter().company.address.street.name.modify(String::toUpperCase)
// Employee(name=John Doe, company=Company(name=Kategory, address=Address(city=Functional city, street=Street(number=42, name=LAMBDA STREET))))
```

## Syntax DSL vs Optics

In contrast to regular optics the DSL is bound to a value. Lets also generate `Lens` and `Optional` for our above domain so we can compare the difference.
In above example we want to apply a function `f` to the `Street::name` of the `Company`'s `Address` of an `Employee`.

We can compose an `Optic` that achieves the same goal.

```kotlin
import arrow.optics.Optional

val employeesStreetName: Optional<Employee, String> = employeeCompany() compose companyAddress() compose addressStreet() compose streetName()
```

The result is an `Optional` since `Employee::company` is nullable. The `Optional` can be used to apply a function `f` to any `Employee`.

```kotlin
employeesStreetName.modify(employee, String::toUpperCase)
// Employee(name=John Doe, company=Company(name=Kategory, address=Address(city=Functional city, street=Street(number=42, name=LAMBDA STREET))))
```

So while Optics are more powerful, the syntax DSL can help you write elegant and concise code.
